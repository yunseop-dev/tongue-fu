					It was when I went to a local ice cream shop with my son. The store was full of customers. The only
					employee was a girl part-timer who appeared to be a high school student. It seemed to be in a hurry
					to process the order in its own way, but the customers showed no signs of decreasing.
					<br />
					<br />
					We had to wait half an hour before it was our turn. I ordered three cans of chocolate ice cream. The
					exhausted girl exploded in front of me. It'sincerely three? Do you know how hard it is to scoop out
					ice cream from this container?"

					You're working at a restaurant. A customer beckons to you during a busy evening and complains like this. 'Hey, waiter. I ordered it because I thought it would be fresh because it was a special menu. But the salmon is still frozen. It's a salmon that's been out of the water for a long time." How would you answer that?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="step">
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Explain why</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Fresh salmon was supposed to come in today, but there was no product in the market, so I used frozen salmon.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Extend the argument.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The chef said it's frozen, but it's very fresh. There's almost no difference in taste.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Avoid responsibility.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>It's not my fault. If there were no ingredients, the manager had to adjust the menu on his own.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

				</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="step">
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Think about whether the customer's words are true, and if so, I admit it.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>You're right. The menu says fresh salmon.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Apologize and try to end the quarrel.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>I'm sorry I couldn't give you the dish you were looking forward to. I'll change it to another menu you want.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>convey one's thanks</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Thank you for saying this. We want everyone who visits the restaurant to be satisfied with the food and visit again.</li>

		<h1>Finishing</h1>
		<p>The first thing I thought about reading this book was, "No way! should I endure the unpleasant things all the time?" If you live with patience every time, you'll get a vase, but you get angry every time
			If you pay, there will be no people left around.</p>
		<p>However, the "Tongue-Fu" that I introduced today is a technic that stands firmly without hurting oneself or hurting others.</p>
		<p>It seems like I'm bowing for others, but it's a skill that can raise others and raise myself.</p>
		<p>It seems to teach you how to win a verbal battle by comparing it to kung fu, but rather teach you how to lose. But the losing method teaches me the skills that make me win.</p>
		<p>We hope that our respect for each other will develop more beautifully in the future, and we will end the seminar by sharing the phrases that came to mind while preparing for the seminar. Thank you.</p>
		<br />
